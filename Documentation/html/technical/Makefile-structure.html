<H1 Align=Center>Makefile structure for the TLVC project</H1>

<P Align=Justify>This document describes the intended structure of the 
Makefiles in the TLVC project, and the standards that should apply to have
a completely rational system. It makes a number of assumptions about how
the process of compiling TLVC works, and these assumptions are hopefully
documented here:</P>

<OL>

<LI><P Align=Justify>TLVC is not yet able to compile itself, so it has to
be compiled under another operating system and ported across. It is not in
general possible to use the same compiler to compile TLVC as to compile
software designed to run under the other operating system, so there is a
need for TWO sets of compilation rules, one for compiling TLVC and another
for compiling the tools used in the process of configuring and compiling
TLVC.</P>

<LI><P Align=Justify>TLVC is complex enough to require multiple levels of
source directories. It is assumed that all actions relating to the files
in a given source directory will be documented in the Makefile in that
directory.</P>

</OL>

<P Align=Justify>Based on these assumptions, the following design is
offered for a coherent and rational Makefile system:</P>

<OL>

<LI><P Align=Justify>There will be a file <B>Makefile-rules</B> in the
base directory of the TLVC source tree that collects together the standard
rules for all subordinate Makefiles.</P>

<LI><P Align=Justify>Each <B>Makefile</B> in the source tree will begin by
defining the following variables...</P>

<Center>

<Table Border=1 Width=80%>

<TR>
<TH Width=20%>Variable</TH>
<TH Width=70%>Definition</TH>
<TH Width=10%>Values</TH>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD Align=Center VAlign=Center>TLVCCODE</TD>
<TD><P Align=Justify>States whether the current directory contains code
that compiles to become part of the TLVC kernel, or code that compiles to
produce tools to be used when configuring or compiling the TLVC
kernel.</P></TD>
<TD Align=Center>YES<BR>NO</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD Align=Center VAlign=Center>TLVCDIR</TD>
<TD><P Align=Justify>The relative path from the current directory to the
base directory of the TLVC source tree.</P></TD>
</TR>

</Table>

</Center>

<P Align=Justify>...and then includes the line...</P>

<P Align=Center><Font Size=+1>include $(TLVCDIR)/Makefile-rules</Font></P>

<P Align=Justify>...to generate the standard values and rules. Only AFTER
it has done this may any other definitions be made.</P>

<P Align=Justify>Once this has been done, the following additional
variables have been defined and are available for use:</P>

<Center>

<Table Border=1 Width=80%>

<TR>
<TH Width=20%>Variable</TH>
<TH Width=80%>Definition</TH>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD Align=Center>DISTDIR</TD>
<TD><P Align=Justify>The absolute path of the directory to copy files to
when making a distribution copy of this directory.</P></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD Align=Center>TOPDIR</TD>
<TD><P Align=Justify>The absolute path to the TLVC base
directory.</P></TD>
</TR>

</Table>

</Center>

<LI><P Align=Justify>The following rules <B>MUST</B> be defined in each
Makefile. Each only needs to deal with appropriate files in its own
directory as they are called recursively on each directory containing
Makefile files.</P>

<OL>

<LI><H2>cleandir:</H2>

<P Align=Justify>This rule performs any actions required to clean up the
files in this directory beyond the standard actions of removing any files
named <B>core</B> together with all files with names matching <B>*~</B> or
<B>*.o</B> or <B>*.tmp</B> and finally removing any files named <B>*.s</B>
where a matching <B>*.S</B> file exists.</P>

<P>The above files will be removed automatically and no special action
needs to be taken to remove them. Likewise, no special action needs to be
taken to remove files in any subdirectories containing a Makefile as this
rule is called recursively on all subdirectories.</P>

<LI><H2>distdir:</H2>

<P Align=Justify>This rule performs any actions required to create a
distribution copy of the files in this directory beyond the standard steps
of creating
