# What is ELKS?

ELKS is a project providing a Linux-like OS for systems based on the Intel
IA16 architecture (16-bit processors: 8086, 8088, 80188, 80186, 80286,
NEC V20, V30 and compatibles). Such systems are ancient computers (IBM-PC
XT / AT and clones) as well as more recent SBCs, SoCs, and FPGAs.
