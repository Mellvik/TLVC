/* This allows for 20 file descriptors: if NR_OPEN is ever grown beyond
 * that you'll have to change this too. For now 20 fd's seem to be
 * enough for ELKS, so hopefully this won't need changing.
 *
 * Note that POSIX wants the FD_CLEAR(fd,fdsetp) defines to be in
 * <sys/time.h> (and thus <linux/time.h>) - but this is a more logical
 * place for them. Solved by having dummy defines in <sys/time.h>.
 *
 * Those macros may have been defined in <gnu/types.h>. But we always
 * use the ones here.
