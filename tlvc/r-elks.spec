# C preprocessor options.

# 1) Bruce's C compiler defines either __MSDOS__ or __ELKS__; follow it here.
#
# 2) The -isystem stuff is a hack.  When -mr=elks is specified, then, combined
#    with the -nostdinc above, this hack will (try to) make GCC use the
#    include files under the -mr=elks multilib directory, rather than the
#    Newlib include files in the usual locations.
#
#     We also need to extend the hack to
#	* rope in the libgcc include directories --- via `include-fixed' ---
#	  since elks-libc's headers use libgcc's;
#	* fall back on the include directories for the default calling
#	  convention (.../ia16-elf/lib/elkslibc/include/), in case the user
#	  says e.g. `-mr=elks -mregparmcall' and no include files are
#	  installed specifically for this calling convention.
#
#     Again, this is a hack.  -- tkchia
