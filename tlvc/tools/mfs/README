                   Minix FileSystem Tool

This utility is used to manipulate Minix filesystem images in user-space.
It can be used to extract files and generate full images for using in
embedded system and/or Linux init ram disks.

Unlike mounting through Linux's mount device, this tool does not require
root priviledges and will allow regular users create device nodes on
the file system.
