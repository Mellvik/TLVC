This is elkscmd, a loose collection of user space code for ELKS including
most of what you need apart from the kernel to build a working system.

This package has been put together for two main purposes:

1. To make it as easy as possible to put together a working binary release
   of a complete ELKS system.

2. To make it as easy as possible for other developers to accuratly
   reproduce a release.

The Makefiles contain rules which automatically build disk images for
the ELKS system. In order to do this you must have the source code to the ELKS
kernel, and the definitions at the top of the Make.defs point to the correct
source directories.
