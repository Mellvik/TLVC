CRON is a small cron daemon (& crontab program) for UN*X-style systems
that is almost, but not quite, posixish.

CRON is free software;  it is released under a BSD-style license
that allows you to do as you wish with it as long as you don't attempt
to claim it as your own work.

Most of the programs included in the CRON distribution have
manual pages describing how they work.
