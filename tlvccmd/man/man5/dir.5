.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.ft B
#include <dirent.h>
.SH DESCRIPTION
The directories of the MINIX and FAT file systems are arrays of the
following structure defined in <dirent.h>:
.PP
.nf
.ta +5n +15n +15n
#define MAXNAMLEN	26		   /* 14 for MINIX, 26 for FAT */
struct dirent {
	u_ino_t	d_ino;	        /* I-node number */
	unsigned short d_namlen;
	char	d_name[MAXNAMLEN+1];   /* File name */
};
.fi
.DT
.PP
The
.B d_ino
field is the inode number of the file named by
.BR d_name .
.B D_ino
is zero if the directory slot isn't allocated.  This number is the same as
.B st_ino
returned by
.BR stat (2)
unless the entry is mounted on.
.B D_name
is the name of up to 26 characters, null-terminated.
Any character other than null or '\fB/\fP' is allowed.
.PP
See
.BR directory (3)
for a portable way to access directories, ELKS and MINIX 3 are probably the last systems
with these old V7 format directories.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
