.TH FTPD 8 ELKS
.SH NAME
ftpd \- Internet File Transfer Protocol server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ftpd
.RB [ \-d ]
.RB [ \-q ]
.RI [ port ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Ftpd
implements the server side of the Internet File Transfer Protocol,
and listens to the standard FTP port # 21, unless otherwise specified on the command line.
.PP
If the 
.B \-d
option is specified,
debugging information is written to the console. Multiple 
.B \-d
options may be specified for increased verbosity level. More than 4 is not meaningful.
.B Ftpd
will normally detach itself from the controlling terminal. If the debug level is 2 or higher, such detach is prevented. 
.PP
If the
.B \-q
option is specified or the environment variable 
.I QEMU=1 
is present,
.B ftpd
will assume it is running in the QEMU emulator and remap ports and IP-addresses accordingly.
The mappings correspond with the setup provided for QEMU in the 
.I qemu.sh
script in the ELKS distribution. When QEMU mode is active, the server 
will look for loopback connections (ELKS internal) and turn off QEMU mode 
if detected, in order for file transfers to work correctly. This is meaningful for testing only.
.PP
The ftp server
will timeout an inactive session after 15 minutes. 
.PP
The ftp server currently supports (or will support) the following ftp
requests; case is not distinguished. The commands marked with a '*' are planned, but not currently implemented.

.PP
The remaining ftp requests specified in Internet RFC 959 are
reported as unrecognized.
.PP
For simplicity, the 
.I TYPE
command is ignored. File transfers are always binary (IMAGE mode), directory transfers are ASCII.
This applies only to the server, it is still necessary to set the desired transfer mode in the client.
.PP
The ftp server will abort an active file transfer only when the
ABOR command is preceded by a Telnet "Interrupt Process" (IP)
signal and a Telnet "Synch" signal in the command Telnet stream,
as described in Internet RFC 959. (Not yet implemented in ELKS].
.PP
The
.I SITE 
command implements only the
.I IDLE
subcommand, which without a parameter will display the current idle timeout value in seconds. Add a numeric argument to the 
.i IDLE 
subcommand to set the timeout value. Acceptable range is 30 to 2700 seconds.
.B Ftpd
interprets file names according to the ``globbing''
conventions used by the ELKS 
.IR sash (1).
This allows users to utilize the metacharacters ``*?[].
.PP
The current ELKS-implementation of 
.B ftpd
requires username and password to be specified, but ignores them. 
Future implementations may support authentication via 
.IR /etc/passwd ,
(no null passwords), and 
.IR /etc/ftpusers ,
which contains user names not to be allowed 
.B ftp 
access.
Anonymous authentication is not supported.
.PP
.B Ftpd
implements no securtity measures, and runs from the authenticated user's (currently root) home directory.
CWD to any directory is allowed, which - in combination with the DELETE and RMDIR commands - may be very dangerous.

.SH BUGS
The lack of security measures makes it easy for inexperienced users to inflict havoc on the system.
