.TH SETUP 8
.SH NAME
setup \- set up some basic parameters for ELKS runtime
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBsetup\fP \fInumber\fR \fIbootopts-string\fR
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsetup\fR is a simple script to enable fast setup of several ELKS systems in a network. 
The first parameter is the 'host number', the rightmost number of the system's IP address. 
By default, an ELKS system has the IP address 10.0.2.15. The command
.sp
.B setup 17
.sp
will edit the 
.I /etc/hosts
file so that the local address becomes 10.0.2.17 and also set the hostname to
.IR elks17 .
.PP
The second argument - if present - is a quick way to uncomment a line in the standard 
.I /bootopts
file. By default most lines in 
.I /bootopts 
are commented out with a leading hash (#) mark.
.B setup 
removes the hash mark from the first line containing the string in the second argument - if any. For example,
if 
.I /bootopts
contains the line
.sp
.B #console=ttyS0,57600 debug net=ne0 3 # sercons, multiuser, networking
.sp
then the command
.sp
.B setup 16 debug
.sp
will remove the hash and thus enable that line.
.SH BUGS
.B setup
is very limited in its current incarnation and subject to rapid changes.
