.SH DESCRIPTION
In the first form,
.I mread
copies the specified MSDOS file to the named Unix file.  The second form
of the command copies multiple MSDOS files to the named Unix directory.
MSDOS sub directories are supported with either the '/' or '\e\'
separator.  The use of the '\e\' separator or wildcards will require the
names to be enclosed in quotes to protect them from the shell.
.PP
.I Mread
will allow the following command line options:
.TP
.B t
Text file transfer.
.I Mread
will translate incoming carriage return/line feeds to line feeds.
.TP
.B n
No warning.
.I Mread
will not warn the user when overwriting an existing file.
.TP
.B m
Preserve the file modification times.
.PP
If the target file already exists, and the
.I -n
option is not in effect,
.I mread
asks whether or not to overwrite the file.
.PP
The environmental variable MCWD may be used to establish a current
working directory (relative to the MSDOS diskette).
.SH SEE ALSO
mcopy(1), mdir(1), mtype(1), mwrite(1)
.SH BUGS
Wildcards are only applied to filenames, not to directory names.
Unlike MSDOS, the destination directory may not be omitted.
