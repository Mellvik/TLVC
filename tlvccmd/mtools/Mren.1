.SH NAME
mren \- rename an existing MSDOS file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mren
[
.B -v
] sourcefile targetfile
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Mren
renames an existing file on a MSDOS formatted diskette.  Sub directories
are supported with either the '/' or '\e\' separator.  The use of
the '\e\' separator or wildcards will require the names to be enclosed
in quotes to protect them from the shell.
.PP
.I Mren
will allow the following command line option:
.TP
.B v
Verbose mode.  Display the new file name if the name supplied is
invalid.
.PP
Reasonable care is taken to create a valid MSDOS filename.  If an invalid
MSDOS target name is specified,
.I mren
will change the name (and prompt the user to accept or reject the new name
if the verbose mode is set).
.PP
The path component of the target filename (if supplied) is ignored.  In
other words, you may not use
.I mren
to move a file from one sub directory to another.
.PP 
.I Mren
may also be used to rename directories.
.PP
The environmental variable MCWD may be used to establish a current
working directory (relative to the MSDOS diskette).

.SH BUGS
Wildcards are only applied to filenames, not to directory names.
MSDOS doesn't use ren to rename directories.
