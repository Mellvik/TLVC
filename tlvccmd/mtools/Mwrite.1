.SH NAME
mwrite \- low level write (copy) a Unix file to MSDOS
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mwrite
[
.B -tnvm
] unixfile msdosfile
.PP
.B mwrite
[
.B -tnvm
] unixfile [ unixfiles... ] msdosdirectory
.SH DESCRIPTION
In the first form,
.I mwrite
copies the specified Unix file to the named MSDOS file.  The second form
of the command copies multiple Unix files to the named MSDOS directory.
MSDOS sub directories are are supported with either the '/' or '\e\'
separator.  The use of the '\e\' separator will require the names to be
enclosed in quotes to protect them from the shell.
.PP
.I Mwrite
will allow the following command line options:
.TP
.B t
Text file transfer.
.I Mwrite
will translate incoming line feeds to carriage return/line feeds.
.TP
.B n
No warning.
.I Mwrite
will not warn the user when overwriting an existing file.
.TP
.B v
Verbose mode.  Display the new file name if the Unix file name requires
conversion.
.TP
.B m
Preserve the file modification times.
.PP
If the target file already exists, and the
.I -n
option is not in effect,
.I mwrite
asks whether or not to overwrite the file.
.PP
Reasonable care is taken to create a valid MSDOS filename.  If an
invalid name is specified,
.I mwrite
will change the name (and display the new name if the verbose mode is
set).
.PP
The environmental variable MCWD may be used to establish a current
working directory (relative to the MSDOS diskette).
.SH SEE ALSO
mcopy(1), mdir(1), mread(1)
.SH BUGS
Wildcards are only applied to filenames, not to directory names.
Unlike MSDOS, the destination directory may not be omitted.
