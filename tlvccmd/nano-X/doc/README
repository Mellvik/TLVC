Micro-Windows README 6/27/1999 g haerr

Micro-Windows is a reimplementation of the win32 api
that runs on Linux, ELKS, MSDOS and bare VGA hardware.  It
uses the same device-independent graphics engine built for 
the nanoGUI project.  Micro-Windows compiles a sample
application and the win32 graphics api in about 42k.

The architecture of Micro-Windows allows it to be ported
or run on a wide variety of systems.  There are currently
screen drivers for Linux 2.2.x framebuffers and Linux 2.0.x
svgalib.  There exists a portable 4-planes VGA driver that
will run on bare hardware, ELKS, or MSDOS (a framebuffer version
of this is coming).  There are mouse drivers written for 
bare hardware as well as the Linux GPM driver.  The Micro-Windows
graphics engine is capable of running on any system that
support readpixel, writepixel, drawhline and drawvline.

Micro-Windows features full RGB color support, optimized
palette bitmap drawing, and a Win95 identical look-and-feel.
Overlapped and child windows are supported, with complete
window and client area clipping.  Proportional and fixed
fonts are supported, along with utilities for converting
any MS Windows font or .bmp file.  Optimized painting
algorithms are used to allow maximum response while the
user is moving windows on the screen.

In addition, the nano-X server can also be built on top of
the device-independent graphics engine.
