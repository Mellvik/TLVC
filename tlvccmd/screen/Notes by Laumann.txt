"screen" is a window manager that allows you to handle several independent
screens (UNIX ttys) on a single physical terminal; each screen has its own
set of processes connected to it (typically interactive shells).  Each
virtual terminal created by "screen" emulates a DEC VT100 plus several ANSI
X3.64 and ISO 2022 functions (including DEC VT102 features such as line and
character deletion and insertion).

Since "screen" uses pseudo-ttys, the select system call, and UNIX-domain
sockets, it will not run under a system that does not include these
features of 4.2 and 4.3 BSD UNIX.
